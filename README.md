# ENVS-193DS_homework-05

1. General Information

The data file (hf109-01-sarracenia.csv) is made up of data on 

fish collected in the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to 2022. Although the data contains many columns (specific observations about the fish), for the sake of this project we are only concerned with a few columns, specifically length and weight. The observations were collected once a year from eleven sites.

2. Data and File Overview

This README file gives an overview fo the files within the ENVS-193DS_homework-05 folder (a subset in the broader github folder). The Homework_5.qmd file contains the quarto markdown document which is the main document containing the code and short answers to the problem set. Additionally, there is a rendered document of the PDF version of the markdown (Homework_5.docx), both of which are in the "code.hw5" folder, a subset of the ENVS-193DS_homework-05 folder. Additionally, there is a folder called "data.hw5" (also subset of ENVS-193DS_homework-05) which houses a csv file 

containing fish data collected in the North Temperate Lakes from 1981 to 2022, which is used to test the hypothesis.

4. Methodological information

The fish assemblages of eleven principal lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, Crystal Bog, Trout Bog, Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Fish) are monitered using data that is collected annually. While most lakes began sampling in 1981, Lakes Monona, Wingra, and Fish began sampling in 1995. Seine, crayfish or minnow traps, fyke nets, and electrofishing equipment are used to collect data at six littoral sites per lake. Additionally, two pelagic samples per lake are collected from the deepest point using vertically hung gill nets. Also, at two locations each lake, a trammel net collects samples across the thermocline. Only fyke nets and minnow traps are used in the Trout and Crystal Bog lakes.

5. Data-specific information

The data included species-level identification and lengths for all fish caught, while weight and other samples were only taken from a subset (had lots of missing data).
