# ENVS-193DS_homework-05

1. General Information

The data folder (data.hw5) contains an unzipped folder (knb-lter-hfr.109.18 (3)) which is made up of multiple files containing text and data related to the effects of prey availability on Sarracenia. The file most pertinent to our project is "hf109-01-sarracenia.csv", which contains the information for the 2005 Harvard Forest observations. We are only concerned with a few columns, specifically totmass, species, feedlevel, sla, chlorophyll, amass, num_lvs, and num_phylls. The observations were collected in 2005 from ten different species of sarracenia.

2. Data and File Overview

This README file gives an overview fo the files within the ENVS-193DS_homework-05 folder (a subset in the broader github folder). The Homework_5.qmd file contains the quarto markdown document which is the main document containing the code and short answers to the problem set. Additionally, there is a rendered document of the PDF version of the markdown (Homework_5.docx), both of which are in the "code.hw5" folder, a subset of the ENVS-193DS_homework-05 folder. Additionally, there is a folder called "data.hw5" (also subset of ENVS-193DS_homework-05) which houses a folder (knb-lter-hfr.109.18 (3)) containing data from the 2005 Harvard Forest experiment, notably the file "hf109-01-sarracenia.csv" which is used to test the hypothesis.

4. Methodological information

The fish assemblages of eleven principal lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, Crystal Bog, Trout Bog, Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Fish) are monitered using data that is collected annually. While most lakes began sampling in 1981, Lakes Monona, Wingra, and Fish began sampling in 1995. Seine, crayfish or minnow traps, fyke nets, and electrofishing equipment are used to collect data at six littoral sites per lake. Additionally, two pelagic samples per lake are collected from the deepest point using vertically hung gill nets. Also, at two locations each lake, a trammel net collects samples across the thermocline. Only fyke nets and minnow traps are used in the Trout and Crystal Bog lakes.

5. Data-specific information

The data included species-level identification ("species" column) along with many other measuremnets and calculations, of which we are only interested in a few, as enumerated in the "General Information" section of this README. Additionally, there is some missing data, most notably from the "chlorophyll", "sla", and "amass" columns.
